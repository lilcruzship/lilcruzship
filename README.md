- 👋 Hi, I’m @lilcruzship
- 👀 I’m interested in ... mainly software engineering but also wanting to break into the cyber security world and possibly AI because how advanced it has been getting over the past of years
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... computer science at university of north texas but possible switch over to computer engineering because I'm good with electronics but still want to code and stuff
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any projects i want to learn c++ even though it's mainly used for game development
- 📫 How to reach me ... my email at davidsummerfordd@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I've been learning how to code and program since I was 11, I am 23 years old now. What got me into computer science was the development tools and the sandbox of Valve's source engine and have been hooked ever since then, made me pursue a career in IT
